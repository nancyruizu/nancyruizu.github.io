Graduate Society of Women Engineers 
-----

I'm currently the Vice-President for the Cornell chapter of Grad SWE, where I support the president in directing the executive board and I help to design and organize events for the chapter. In the past, I was the professional development chair (2018-2020), and I organized several events to promote and advance the professional development of women engineers and scientists across campus. Some of the major events I organized were: Panel and Networking dinner with Cornell women faculty, a seminar on how to promote your personal branding through social media, and an Adobe Illustrator Workshop.

Graduate Women In Science
-----

I was the Science Communication officer (2019-2020) for the Cornell Graduate Women in Science Chapter, where I helped to organize a science communication event called "Science On Tap", where we invited Cornell faculty and postdocs to give a talk about their research at a local bar to the Ithaca community. The event attracted scientists and non-scientists in an informal atmosphere where everyone could learn about vaccines, climate change, entomology, astrophysics, etc.

Communicating science at the Ithaca ScienceCenter!
-----

With the help of Dr. Steven Adie, me and Rose Buchmann (BME PhD student) designed a little optics demo to show kids from 3-8 years old about light, colors and optics. We used CDs, prisms, and glasses of water to show how light is composed of many colors or **wavelengths**. The demo was initially designed to be in-person but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it ended up being virtual

Expanding your Horizons (EYH) Cornell
-----

[See the Cornell Chronicle article here](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2022/04/biomedical-engineers-inspire-9th-graders-neuroscience)

With Nicole Chernavsky and Pietro Michelucci, I was the co-organizer for the workshop: "Help Cure Alzheimer's Disease!", designed to inspire 9th-grade girls into pursuing careers in STEM. We showcased lasers and other optical tools we use for our research, in addition to stained brains of Alzheimer's disease mouse models. We also gave an overview of our scientific careers and what it means to be a woman in science. The girls also played [StallCatchers](https://stallcatchers.com/main), an online crowd sourcing citizen science game where people can help analyze our multiphoton microscopy images.

Qu√© significa ser mujer en la ciencia?
------
I enjoy giving talks in Spanish about my research and life experiences. In this opportunity, I spoke about what it means to be a women in science, specially coming from a background as a latina, first generation graduate student. The talk was aimed at engineering undergraduate students from the IEST Anahuac institute in Tamaulipas, Mexico.
