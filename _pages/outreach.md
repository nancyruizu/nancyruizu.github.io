Graduate Society of Women Engineers 
-----

I'm currently the Vice-President for the Cornell chapter of Grad SWE, where I support the president in directing the executive board and I help to design and organize events for the chapter. In the past, I was the professional development chair (2018-2020), and I organized several events to promote and advance the professional development of women engineers and scientists across campus. Some of the major events I organized were: Panel and Networking dinner with Cornell women faculty, a seminar on how to promote your personal branding through social media, and an Adobe Illustrator Workshop.

Graduate Women In Science
-----

I was the Science Communication officer (2019-2020) for the Cornell Graduate Women in Science Chapter, where I helped to organize a science communication event called "Science On Tap", where we invited Cornell faculty and postdocs to give a talk about their research at a local bar to the Ithaca community. The event attracted scientists and non-scientists in an informal atmosphere where everyone could learn about vaccines, climate change, entomology, astrophysics, etc.
