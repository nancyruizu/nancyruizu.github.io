Education
======
* B.S. in Physics, Universidad de los Andes, Colombia, 2016
* B.S. in Biology, Universidad de los Andes, Colombia, 2017
* M.S. in Biomedical Engineering, Cornell University, 2019
* Ph.D in Biomedical Engineering, Cornell University, 2022 (expected)

Work experience
======

* 2017-current, Graduate Student
  * Cornell University, Ithaca, NY.
  * Currently investigating the role of cerebral blood flow (CBF) deficits in the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) through in vivo multiphoton imaging. 
  * Supervisor: Chris Schaffer, PhD.

* Summer 2022: Consultant
  * Genentech, San Francisco, CA.
  * I'm continuing the work from the past summer in understanding the prognostic utility of tau PET and white matter hyperintensities for cognitive decline in mild and prodromal AD patients. In addition, I'm preparing a poster showcasing this work for the 2022 Alzheimer's Association International Conference in San Diego, CA. 
  * Supervisor: Edmond Teng, MD, PhD. 

* Summer 2021: Clinical Science Intern
  * Genentech, San Francisco, CA.
  * Explored the prognostic utility of tau PET for cognitive vs functional decline in mild to prodromal Alzheimer's disease patients from the semorinemab phase-two clinical trials
  * Supervisor: Edmond Teng, MD, PhD. 

* Summer 2018: Research Intern
  * Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY.
  * Developed a magnetic imaging phantom and optimized a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence for imaging chest wall deformity in patients with breast tissue expanders. Assessed the amount of chest wall compression in more than 50 patients with expanders and implants. Trained to acquire images of phantoms and patients with a MRI machine.
  * Supervisor: Martin Prince, MD, PhD. 

* Summer 2016: Research Intern
  * Laboratory of Neurophysiology and New Microscopies , Paris, France. 
  * Performed in vivo two-photon imaging of the mouse olfactory bulb under sensory stimuli and light stimulation in genetically modified and naive animals.
  * Supervisor: Serge Charpak, PhD. 

* Summer 2015: Research Intern
  * Applied and Engineering Physics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY.
  * Performed in vivo three-photon microscopy to visualize neurons and calcium dynamics in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons of the mouse brain
  * Supervisor: Chris Xu, PhD. 

* June 2013 - August 2016: Undergraduate Research Assistant
