About me
======
I'm a doctoral student in the Schaffer-Nishimura lab at Cornell University.

Research Interests
------

I study Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in brain tissue, which leads to progressive and irreversible neurodegeneration. In particular, I am fascinated by understanding what causes blood flow deficits in AD mouse models and human patients, and how by rescuing blood flow we can ammeliorate cognitive decline. My research focuses on capillary stalling, a phenomenon in which capillary vessels in the brain get obstructed by the adhesion of neutrophils or other circulating cells, and such stalling impairs blood flow significantly. I use both in-vivo imaging and molecular techniques with AD mouse models to answer two key questions regarding what drives capillary stalling: *1.) Is this phenomenon mediated by vascular inflammation induced by oxidative stress? and if yes, 2) which inflammatory molecules are in charge of this process?*  

In vivo two and three photon microscopy
------

To understand vascular dynamics *in vivo*, I use multiphoton imaging to visualize blood vessels and measure blood flow in a *live* animal. By using different fluorescent labelling strategies, we can visualize leukocytes, platelets and red blood cells, and understand which cells are adhering to the vascular endothelium causing capillary stalling. To gain optical access to the brain, I perform cranial window surgeries on AD mouse models, which allows visualization of neurons, cells and the vasculature up to 1 mm deep (with three-photon imaging).

Animal Behavior 
------

Navigation requires knowledge of both environmental landmarks and an animal's current position. Animal movements can reveal critical information about the state of an animal that is navigating an environment. Below depicts a rat's path while exploring an open field with a local cue. While the rat tended to stay near the local cue, the path in the middle of the field shows head sweeping of the environment. This type of information, along with other features obtained from animal tracking, is critical for understanding spatial navigation.
