ComSciCon NY 2019 
-----

I was fortunate to be part of the organizing committee for the first New York State Communicating Science Conference (ComSciCon) in 2019, where we brought students, scientists, science communicators and policy experts to Cornell for a two-day workshop. The workshop was geared towards graduate students who were interested in learning how to communicate science more effectively and making it more accesible. After the event, I had the fantastic opportunity to travel to the AAAS conference in Seattle, WA, with two other organizers. Feel free to read [the press release I wrote](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/news/comscicon-cornell-grows-6th-year) about the event.

Policy memo about regenerative agriculture in the US
-----

As part of the Science Policy Bootcamp class (BME 4440) at Cornell, me and three other graduate students wrote a policy memo about how the agricultural system in the US is unsustainable in the long term, and how novel alternatives such as regenerative agriculture can help solve large scale problems such as food insecurity and climate change. Feel free to read the memo [here.](https://www.sciencepolicyjournal.org/article_1038126_jspg190106.html)

NatureVolve
-----
Dr. Oliver Bracko (a former postdoc in my lab) and me wrote a piece for the NatureVolve magazine where we explain our research in a fun and accessible way, combined with beautiful pictures and graphics. Check the publication [here](https://www.pressreader.com/uk/nature-volve/20210201)

Podcast interviews

I've participated in a number of podcasts about my research and life trajectories: here you can find examples of an interview I had for [Locally Sourced Science](https://locallysourcedscience.org/2021/02/16/lss-106-the-story-of-the-new-cornell-cals-dean-and-what-is-new-in-alzheimers-research/), an interview for the podcast [Science Blender about Imposter Syndrome](http://scienceblender.com/8-the-imposter-syndrome/), another for [TidBits of Research](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb-kmstk-10648fe), and one for [BluRadio](https://www.bluradio.com/salud/nancy-ruiz-la-colombiana-que-hace-avances-medicos-para-combatir-el-alzheimer), a local radio station from my home country, Colombia.
