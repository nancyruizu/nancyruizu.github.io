ComSciCon NY 2019 
-----

I was fortunate to be part of the organizing committee for the first New York State Communicating Science Conference (ComSciCon) in 2019, where we brought students, scientists, science communicators and policy experts to Cornell for a two-day workshop. The workshop was geared towards graduate students who were interested in learning how to communicate science more effectively and making it more accesible. Feel free to read [the press release I wrote](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/news/comscicon-cornell-grows-6th-year) about the event
